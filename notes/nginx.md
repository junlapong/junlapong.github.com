# Install nginx and mariadb

## nginx

```
brew insstall nginx
```

Docroot is: `/usr/local/var/www`

The default port has been set in `/usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` to `8080` so that
nginx can run without sudo.

nginx will load all files in `/usr/local/etc/nginx/servers/.`

To have launchd start nginx now and restart at login:

```
brew services start nginx
```

Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:

```
nginx
```


## mariadb

```
brew install mariadb
```

A `/etc/my.cnf` from another install may interfere with a Homebrew-built
server starting up correctly.

MySQL is configured to only allow connections from `localhost` by default

To connect:

```
mysql -uroot
```

To have launchd start mariadb now and restart at login:

```
brew services start mariadb
```

Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:

```
mysql.server start
```
