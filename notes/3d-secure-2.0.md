### Authentication Flows, and examples

#### Changes in flows

The biggest difference since 3DS 1.0 is the **Frictionless flow** which allows issuer to approve a transaction without cardholder interaction based on risk-based-authentication performed in the ACS. (Steps 1-4 at the figure below)

**Challenge flow** has got changed way of communication from the Issuer to Merchant. In 3DS 2.0 the result of challenge is communicated through the DS. (Step 6 at the figure below) Thus, Merchant is informed about the authentication results via a separate channel, which is more secure.
